# homebrew-tap

This is a _tap_ (3rd-party repository) for my software that can be installed using Homebrew for Apple Macs (or Linuxbrew for Linux).

Use `brew tap classicjazz/tap` to add it to your repository list.

You can then install from any _formula_ I have (check the [Formula](/Formula) folder) using a simple `brew` command.

Letâ€™s assume you wanted to install the `mpv` application:

```bash
brew install mpv
```

or, if a core package should exist with the same name:

```bash
brew install classicjazz/tap/mpv
```
